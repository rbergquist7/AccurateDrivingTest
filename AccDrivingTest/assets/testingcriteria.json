    "Backing Around a Corner": {
      "Description": "This maneuver measures the applicant’s ability to observe traffic from all directions and to back a vehicle safely. This maneuver can be performed from driveways, parking lots and other places where more skill is required than merely backing in a straight line. (Note: When a driveway is not available, the use of an alley, or a corner with curb is permitted. If using a corner this maneuver is best performed by using a 90 degree curb and not rounded corners.)",
      "Notes": null,
      "Instructions": "Advise the applicant to turn into the driveway, alleyway, or if using the corner for the backing maneuver, say “drive to the side of the road and stop” at least three car lengths from the road or intersection. If the maneuver is being conducted at an intersection, advise the applicant, “imagine you are backing out of a driveway.” When the applicant is stopped, give the instructions.\nInstruct the applicant:'Back around the corner to the right, staying as close to the edge of the road (or curb) as you can. Then safely continue backing in a straight line until I say stop.' The applicant should continue backing in a straight line for a distance of 50 feet (two and a half car lengths). If the applicant stops early, instruct them to continue until directed to stop. When the maneuver is complete, instruct the applicant to 'Stop' and 'Reenter traffic.'",
